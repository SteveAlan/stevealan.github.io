                    I'm Pham Quoc Hung, a junior front-end developer and web UI/UX designer. I can develop the theme and interface of websites and applications besides. I have trained and experienced well for 2 years of Java and 1 year of Javascript. Hence, my expertises has been strengthened with technologies and academical models such as: <i>Object-oriented Program, MVC Model, Design Pattern, Algorithm building, Responsive Web Building and Material Design</i>. In addition, I have a special attraction to <strong>Flat Design and Minimalism Design</strong>, this website could be consider as a live example.
                </p><p>
                    Learning new languages and technology is what I am passionate about and what I can flexibly adapt to working environment. For example, I self-learnt basic to intermediate edges of Java in 2 weeks and write a Terminal program without using external libraries. 
                </p><p>
                    Well using foreign languages is my advantage, English especially. I can read specialized books and understand terminologies, and I can also make a conversation or presentation by English with North American accent pronounciation.
                </p><p>
                    Finally, I am regular member of <a href="http://daynhauhoc.com">Daynhauhoc</a> forum, where I can share my knowledge and fill the gaps in my expertises. As a consider, I like to help team's members to push working progress up with code reviewing, mentoring and planning.
